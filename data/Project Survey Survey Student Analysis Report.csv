Maybe it's a class that we really need to pay more efforts after class. The coding is appropriate now. Most are what I've seen in PSTAT 160A. Despite that, I'd prefer less coding in homework. However, if TAs can cover some syntax in sections, I think more coding also works. Alex did a great job applying the theories to real life problems, so I think I'm comfortable with the proportion of theories to applications. One small advice could be to include review sessions or lectures before the Midterm since I'm quite unsure about how well I've digested the materials so far.

For the final project, I prefer to cover a new application. Try to solve a problem on my own seems more interesting to me compared to read new materials and summarize. Hope the problem is not hard though. I prefer a written report if the presentation is in-person. But if the presentation is designed to be pre-taped, I definitely prefer a presentation.

* Homework seems a little difficult + time-consuming at times

I would be interested in learning python as I am currently using it for another class as well, but do not feel very confident in my abilities and worry that a super coding-heavy project would be very difficult for me. I have enjoyed the theory of this class greatly and would prefer to learn more about theory rather than application. The class gets very interesting when we discuss real-world examples, mainly the Google PageRank stuff. It makes it so much easier to understand and I find it much more valuable than doing computations without conceptualization. I vote that we continue learning theory and summarizing. As for a final project, I would also prefer a written report. Finals tend to get very stressful for me and there is a lot of beauty in writing something out, turning it in, and not having to deal with test/presentation anxiety.

I have greatly enjoyed this course so far and I am looking forward to continuing it. Thank you so much for your hard work.",0.0,1,0,0.0
