I would prefer a more coding oriented project so that I can put it on my resume. In terms of material, if we do a coding based project, I'd rather summarize rather than solve AND code. However, if we did a presentation, I would be fine with solving a problem. If we have a coding project, it might be nice to have a small presentation component or a google drive where we can see everyone's work. In-person presentations may be difficult because it takes class time.Â
