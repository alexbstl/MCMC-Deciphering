* As I'm striving to work in the tech industry, more coding-oriented projects would help sharpen my Python skills. I would also like to see shorter and easier coding questions outside of "boss mode" in homework.

* I like to solve problems on my own. I'm more of a hands-on person than a reader.

* I don't mind whether the report is going to be written or presented. However, if the presentation is the case, then I would prefer it to be in person.Â 

* I like how the Google search analogy helped me understand the mathematical material better. I would like more real-life application analogies in the future.
