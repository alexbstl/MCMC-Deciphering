I thought the class was going with a fast pace last week, but I think it's good for now because the YouTube videos are great helps! Maybe it's a class that we really need to pay more efforts after class. The coding is appropriate now. Most are what I've seen in PSTAT 160A. Despite that, I'd prefer less coding in homework. However, if TAs can cover some syntax in sections, I think more coding also works. Alex did a great job applying the theories to real life problems, so I think I'm comfortable with the proportion of theories to applications. One small advice could be to include review sessions or lectures before the Midterm since I'm quite unsure about how well I've digested the materials so far.

For the final project, I prefer to cover a new application. Try to solve a problem on my own seems more interesting to me compared to read new materials and summarize. Hope the problem is not hard though. I prefer a written report if the presentation is in-person. But if the presentation is designed to be pre-taped, I definitely prefer a presentation.
